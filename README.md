# Who WantZ To Be a Millionaire

A text-based, create your own adventure game, based on the popular tv show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire... but with a twist! 
As the main character of the game, you start to realise that not everything is as it seems...

How to play the game:
Simply load the file to your codereader (we used VSCode), and run the code. The game will print to terminal. 

This was a group effort between myself, Will, Billy, Fenn and Charles, during the Develop:Coding course at CodeNation! 

Enjoy!
